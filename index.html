      The behavior of people in the ocean could be divided between those who remain on the surface and those who decide to dive into it.
      <br>
      <br> There are people who are capable of diving to great depths, reaching a broader perspective of the environment and the rest of the beings existing in the ocean. Looking from the depths, they can appreciate the vast majority splashing on the surface.
      <br>
      <br> The reasons why they developed this ability are diverse. Perhaps they were dragged by others into the abyss without choice, perhaps they had to escape from something that was making them sink little by little, perhaps they were just curious and encouraged to explore a new reality.
      <br>
      <br> Fear of the unknown and an environment they do not control prevents many from daring to explore and know the greatness of the ocean. For others, swimming continuous storms on the surface makes it impossible for them to stop and prepare for the dive into the quiet depths. And for many others, it is simply ignorance that there is a world beyond what our eyes appreciate.
      <br>
      <br> Depth is revealing and calm, but it can be overwhelming, and one must return to the surface to catch a breath. It is necessary to recover after a deep dive, to return to a less demanding place where discoveries can be analyzed. Understanding the requirements to move through this space will make us more capable and able to dive to avoid the jolts of stormy waves.
      <br>
      <br> The surface is seemingly safer, but it can become incredibly monotonous or extremely chaotic. The variability of this environment leads us to experience both boring periods and exhausting times. We can feel governed by the waves and other events beyond our control, lacking the balance that exists in the deep waters.
      <br>
      <br> However, it is important for those capable of diving into remote places to enjoy the different levels and the surface. Understanding the aquatic capabilities of the people around us will help us deepen our relationships correctly.
